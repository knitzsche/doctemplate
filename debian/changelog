doctemplate (2.5.0.1) raring; urgency=low

  * Add optional support for running postprocessing script in docbook phase
    of build, as follows:
    - Your customization branch (the one pointed to by the CUSTOM variable the
      project 'environment' file must export DBSCRIPT variable whose value
      is script name in CUSTOM/docbook-customization/. For example:
      if environment has these:
      export CUSTOM=../customization-brochure
      export DBSCRIPT=brochure.sh
      Then the following must exist:
      ../customization-brochure/docbook-customization/brochure.sh
    - That file "brochure.sh" is executed after the normal docbook phase. It may
      1) run another xsl transform on the normal generated end file of the
      docbook transform: build/docbook//LINGUA/DOC.xml generating a new file doc
      2) rename the new files so the new generated doc is named
      build/docbook//LINGUA/DOC.xml
    - note that the script is passed three arguments in the following order:
      1) the path to the customization dir (as defined in the project environment file)
      2) the path to the current docbook build dir, including linguage, for example:
      build/docbook/fr/
      3) the name of the project's root content doc (withoout the .xml extension)
      as defined in the project environment file.
    - A sample DBSCRIPT:
      #!/bin/bash
      set -e
      CUSTOM=$1
      BDOCBOOK=$2
      DOC=$3
      xsltproc \
          --stringparam showSlideTitles yes \
          -o $BDOCBOOK/book.custom.xml \
          $CUSTOM/docbook-customization/brochure.xsl \
          $BDOCBOOK/$DOC.xml
      # back up initial state of book.xml

      mv $BDOCBOOK/book.custom.xml $BDOCBOOK/book.xml

doctemplate (2.4.3.11) raring; urgency=low

  * Improve and replace the mechanism for passing module vcs revision so that
    a customization layer may pull it into the content and so be available for
    expression in pdfs. Here are the code comments that sum it up:
    # if DOCBOOKPARAMS contains "showvcsrev yes " and build/vcsrev exists, add param with
    # vcs rev from that file to xslt. Your customization layer may use that, for
    # example adding it to a <releaseinfo> element and displaying that appropriately.
    # Note: this functionality depends on some external mechanism placing the
    # vcs revision in build/vcsrev, for example a wrapper build script that itself
    # calls doctemplate_make

  * let po files live in project po/ dir (not in content/po). And let the build
    copy them to content/po (before doing anything else). When projects are

doctemplate (1.9.38) natty; urgency=low

  * customization/html-customization:
    - javascript.xml implement user control to toggle content area to near full
      screen. When in full mode, the navigation button panel moves to left side
      of screen and buttons are veritical. And, the button panel stays in same 
      vertical position even when scrolling page up and down.
    - to accomplish the above, two new css styles introduced, div.sect1full, which
      resizes div content div to near full screen size, and .buttonpanelsect1vertical
      which rearranges the button panel that present content nagivation to
      vertical stack orientatoin and fixed position. Also, made monospace text
      black instead of orange for readability and made sect2 links in toc fit
      into available space better (no margin above and below)

 -- Kyle Nitzsche <kyle.nitzsche@canonical.com>  Wed, 27 Jul 2011 15:05:09 -0400

doctemplate (1.9.37) natty; urgency=low

  * use jquery instead of customized docbook xslt in html output to add js
    functions to TOC elements. This approach minimizes xslt customization and
    is simpler:
    - customization/html-customization/html-cusomtizatoin/xsl: removed customized
      bits that inserted onclick("showdiv(..);" onto toc anchors because I'd rather
      keep the xslt as pristine as possibled. Instead these functions are added
      via javascript/jquery (see next bullet).
    - Modified customization/html-custumization\javascript.xml code to insert 
    showdiv functions to toc anchors when dom ready.
  * change expected jquery file name in customization/html-customization to
    jquery.js (instead of expecting a file name that includes the jquery version)
    thus enabling updating to a new jquery version by simply dropping the 
    library file into the custom dir. Note: now making html fails if jquery.js
    is not found, with error message.
  * removed adding buttonpanel and buttonpanelsect1 in xslt and instead add them
    through javascript/jquery

doctemplate (1.9.34) natty; urgency=low

  * simplifiy doctemplate_make usage as follows:
    doctemplate_make <build type>, where <build type> no longer needs to 
    include the project type. For example, previously, to build a book project
    to pdf, you would use: 'doctemplate_make book-pdf'. But to build an article
    project to pdf, you would use: doctemplate_make pdf. Now, in both cases,
    you use 'doctemplate_make pdf'. The code checks the TYPE variable defined
    in the proejct's environment file and, by also consulting files in 
    /usr/share/doctemplate/build-types, it determines the valid build types
    for the current project type and enables the simple build types. If you
    don't provide a build type or specify an invalid one, help displays that
    lists the valid build types for the current project.
  * also fixed epub build output for article projects to be standard layout,
    with mimetype file and with included styles.css into OEBPS dir

  * moved bookd-pdf build code from doctemplate_make into doctemplate_functions to

  * now if any po file is missing, it is always created and so builds succeed, 
    although those po files should have their meta data reviwed
  * improved command line output significantly
  * when building (with doctemplate_make <type>) if you add a second arg that is
    a path to a file that file is assumed to be a LINGUAS file and the build

  * add doctemplate html5 project type.
    - Create in pwd with 'doctemplate_setup_html5module'.
    - Build module  with 'doctemplate_make_html5'
  * add book-html5 project type. Combines html5 project modules into html5 book.
    - Create in pwd with 'doctemplate_setup_book_html5'.
    - Edit 'modules' file to add lines that point at doctemplate html5 projects.
    - Build with doctemplate_make_book_html5
  * html5 modules are free standing and can be remixed into books. To suport this,
    there are rules that govern the div structure of module index.xml files, and
    how to add module-specific link tags to add css and script tags to add javascript.
    These are explained in the module's xml/index.xml file (commented).

  * Upgrade html output to have:
    - ubuntu branding (initial)
    - percentage (not pixel) based horizontal layout (nav and content areas)
    - "+" and "-" buttons to expand the nav area (and let content area resize).
      After user expands nav area, any other action restores the (roughly) 25/75
      (nav/content) horiz layout
    - "<" and ">" buttons for next/previous sect1 navigation
    - simpler code throughjquery

    simplification. 
  * doctemplate_setup_article: create doctemplate_version file with only version

doctemplate (1.9.16) maverick; urgency=low

  * doctemplate_functions script had extra lines trying to copy javascript.xml
    file around when building html-ste. This file does not apply (yet) to 
    html-site, so the script function (htmlsite) is modified to remove them.

doctemplate (1.9.14) maverick; urgency=low

  * Remove article customization directories from new article projects. Instead,
    the article's environment file now defines a variable (CUSTOM) that
    provides the path to the dir that contains the required customization
    layers. This allows one to make a customization and use it for any
    article, instead of having to make the customization in each and every
    article. The default/expected location for this directory is a sibling
    directory to the article itself: <article>/../customization. The
    doctemplate_setup_setup_article script now checks whether this directory
    exists and prompts the user to find out whether it should be created.

    enabling, for example <part>s.

doctemplate (1.9.12) maverick; urgency=low

  * Add Ubuntu font configuration and set it as the default for all languages
    except those for which a more appropriate font is in place (ja and zh_TW).
  * Add, for articles, html-site-customization/HTMLSITEPARAMS (to match other
    output customization layers. This hold xsl params to pass to xslproc.
  * Let book's LINGUAs be used to generate article localized xml, instead of 
    always generating all of an article's localized xml, even when the article
    includes linguas the book does not.
  * Slightly better stdout on doctemplate_make_book_pdf
  * Improved upgrade-doctemplate script, which now warns user to back up first
    and waits for their answer before continuing.
  * README file is expanded. And installed in new projects.
  * Refactored src pkg directory layout to better match use case of createing
    articles and books. This simplified doctemplate_setup-article/book
    scripts.

doctemplate (1.9.11) maverick; urgency=low

  * Enable user to override default apache font config by adding dt_fontconfig
    script to project dir. They can copy this script and pick up the default
    font configurations from /usr/bin/dt_fontconfig. Note that adding a font 
    configuration involves creating a conf file in 
    <project>/lib/apache/<font>.conf that points to fop xml files. At the
    moment, for examples look at the doctemplate font config files in
    /usr/share/doctemplate/libe/apache.

    into all localized dirs. that is, there are images that are specific to

    not in article/images. Currently these images are not localizable, althoug
    adding that capability is easily doable.

doctemplate (1.3-0ubuntu0ppa11) karmic; urgency=low

  * This release contains many changes in the following areas:
    - Standard approach to customization: docbook, fop and html customization 
      param files and xsl (for overring standard templates). Note that the 
      *PARAM files mentioned in the previous log entry are moved (with other 
      files) to lib/<type>-customization/, and COMMONPARAMS is renamed to 
      DOCBOOKPARAMS.
    - The lib/html-customizaton and fop-customization dirs implement the 
      "spec file" based approach to titlepage customization. 
    - html generation is now done in two passes: xinclude and docbook.xsl 
      instead of several, which facilitates customization in the 
      usual way (docbook template overrides instead of separate transforms
      to insert html attributes for css)
    - lib/style.css: better design
    - javascript inserted to generated html through standard docbook xsl
      approach and modified to use new override-based html 
    - automatic support for fop hyphenization pattern use if the user
      adds lib/apache/fop-hyph.jar
    - much better pdf layout, with page break after title page, after TOC
      and more

doctemplate (1.3-0ubuntu0ppa10) karmic; urgency=low

  * now there are three user-configurable files for xslt params:

  applied
    - HTMLPARAMS: only applied with make_html (after COMMON, of course)
    - FOPARAMS: only applied with make_pdf (after COMMON, of course)
  * Much improved make_* command line output
  * move user's style.css to project root, instead of using the one in project's
    lib/style.css, in order to allow a user to customize style.css and not have
    the customizations blown away when they update a project from a new version
    of doctemplate (no user-cutomizable files should be in lib, theoretically)

  * fop-customization.xsl should be copied to project root dir so project can
    be updated without deleting project config. setup scripts need to copy it
